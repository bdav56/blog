This is the first blog post. I'm attempting to experiment with r-coding here to see how it looks in html format. I also did a snapshot with renv() to experiment with package management.

I attempted to procure an interesting data set on urban crime in Pennsylvania via a Freedom of Information Request, but the state pointed me to a publicly available dashboard that lacks a sufficient amount of detail. As a result, I will likely focus on sports data sometime in the future.

```{r}
#| echo: true
#| warning: false
#| code-fold: true
#| include: true


library(tidyverse)

cars %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = dist, y = speed)) +
  geom_point(color = "blue") +
  labs(title = "Test Plot",
       subtitle = "Data from Cars Dataset \n",
       x = "Distance",
       y = "Speed") +
  theme_minimal()

```
