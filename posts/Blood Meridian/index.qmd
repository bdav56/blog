## Introduction

Blood Meridian is a coming of age story set in the Wild West of 19th century North America. The book initially refers to the main character as the Kid, but ends the story by referring to him as the Man. The Kid is born in the East of the United States with a drunken schoolmaster as a father. At the age of 14, he possesses innocent eyes but also a brooding taste for violence. He divests himself from the past, moves West, and eventually joins a gang of men captained by John Glanton. This gang contracts with local Mexican governments to collect the scalps of Apache Indians, but they also kill the people of local Mexican towns and peaceful Indians. 

The other main character is the Wild West itself as well as the the worldview that envelopes and guides it. An otherworldlyâ€”and possibly demonic-character named Judge Holden embodies this worldview and attempts to persuade the Gang to accept it.

The Wild West is unique because never again will there be a terrain "So wild and barbarous to try whether the stuff of creation may be shaped to man's will or whether his own heart is another kind of clay." In other words, the Wild West is uniquely capable of testing human nature and determining its capacity for change. Early in the story, a hermit asserts that the Devil was at God's elbow during the creation of man, and that the Kid should not look into his own heart. By the end of the story, however, the Kid becomes the Man after he acts with compassion - a capacity that the story hints at throughout the story.

## A Parable of Two Sons

The Judge tells a parable in the ruins of an Indian tribe that efficiently describes his world view. A harness maker lives in the wilderness with a wife and son. A visitor meets the father; the father attempts to cheat him; and the visitor provides a lecture on how he is a "Loss to God and man alike and would remain so until he took his brother into his heart as he would take himself." The son supports this message, and the father swears that the visitor and son are correct. However, the Father kills the man in secret and lies to his family about the cause. The wife makes a tombstone for the visitor. 

As the father lay dying, he admits his crime exclusively to his son. This son destroys the tombstone and scatters the bone of the visitor. He then becomes a killer of men. As an addition to the story, the Judge then introduces the young wife of the visitor who bears a son after the visitor's death. This second son possesses a false and speculative history of his father.

The parable concludes by saying that the second son is "Broken before a frozen God and will never find his way." Unlike the first son, the second does not understand the "Small mean ways that tempered the man in life." The mystery of the visitor's life in the eyes of his son is similar to the mysterious Indian ruins: both mark a progression from higher to lower order. The point of the parable appears to be that the audience should acknowledge the historical truth which he later describes as human degeneracy, the culling of weak, and the love of games played for stakes.

## The Primacy of Historical Truth

Judge Holden believes historical law subverts moral law because moral law cannot be proven by any ultimate test. He goes onto say that the ultimate test for historical truth is the ultimate trade and ultimately enhanced game: war. In war, a "larger will" makes an irrevocable selection between two competing wills, and this selection is a form of divination. At the end of the book, the Judge adds to this argument by saying that the God of Vengeance an God of Compassion are silent and will remain silent. In other words, the larger will expresses its preferences exclusively through the outcome of conflict. 

## The Kid Becomes a Man

The Kid becomes the Man when he rejects the arguments of the Judge and shows compassion to an elderly women by offering to escort her from a dangerous place. There is no conflict here, no test of wills, and no culling of the weak. The elderly women is similar to a weak man that Judge expresses contempt for as the he attempts to convert the Man to his worldview one last time at the end of the book - both the elderly women and the pathetic man are unable to exert their will onto others.

At the climax of this book, the Kid becomes the Man when he accepts a moral law and acts on it. In the outworking of the climax, however, Judge Holden appears to murder the Man in an outhouse. In my view, this climax and outworking propose that the acceptance of moral law is good and desirable even if the historical law ultimately overcomes it - a dark assessment of the human condition that also appears in other works by Cormac McCarthy.   

## Conclusion

The Wild West was both the meridian and evening of a environment where violence is the only means to settle disagreement. It therefore provides unique insights into human nature.

This is not a book that I would like to read again, but I'm glad I read it. The author does a great job of describing the rhythm of the Wild West by beautifully describing the geography and the interjecting horrific violence at unexpected places. 

The authors assessment of the human condition is dark.... The next book I read will probably be on the lighter side.
