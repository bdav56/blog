# Introduction

*Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep* and *The Demolished Man* are classic science fiction books, and like all good science stories, their premise sets up a thought experiment. The former's premise relates to the existence of androids that are indistinguishable from humanity with one major exception: empathy. The latter's premise relates to the existence of telepathy and its integration into everyday life.

# Human-like Androids

*Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep* is the inspiration for Blade Runner. It takes place in a post apocalyptic earth where human governments encourage humanity to leave earth and settle on other planets in the solar system. Humans use androids for dangerous manual labor, and corporations constantly seek to improve their androids.

The main character is bounty hunter that seeks to identify and kill androids that escape from their assignments. Specialized training is necessary to identify androids because current models are identical to humans with the exception of their lack of empathy and some minor physical differences. The test for empathy involves asking the android questions designed to elicit an emotional response, and then measuring their physiological response.

The story is interesting because of the irony of humanity assessing empathy. Most of the humans remaining on earth seek to buy electric animals - and pretend that they are real - to vainly impress their neighbors with their wealth. In addition, another bounty hunter appears to be cruel to the point that he is unsure if he is an android himself. Finally, the major religion on Earth uses technology to manipulate their own emotions. This last point makes the specialness of human empathy questionable. 

The book seems to be a cautionary tale on creating machines that are indistinguishable from humans. Similar to Blade Runner, some of the androids are the most sympathetic characters. 

# Routine Telepathy

*The Demolished Man* is about a business man who seeks to murder his business rival. The presence of "peepers" who possess telepathic abilities complicates this intention.

Peepers are ingrained in every aspect of life: from business transactions to medical and governmental services. The main character employees peepers to assist in business interactions and anticipate his personal desires. An organization called "The Guild" acts as a professional organization that restricts peepers from unethical behavior. 

The book possesses the feel of comic book with constant action. Personally, however, I find it hard to imagine that normal humans would tolerate the invasion of their minds - I suspect normal humans would condemn and isolate peepers rather than make their services indispensable. 

# Conclusions

Both books were interesting, but the tone was a little too light for me. Rather than a light-hearted exploration of these two premises, I would have preferred to read thought experiments with maximum realism as the goal.
