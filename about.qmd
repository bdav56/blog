The is my Quarto blog. The primary purpose of this blog is to record my thoughts on Science Fiction books and Data Science. Occasionally, I will also post about non-fiction books as well.

Eventually, I hope to post about Sports Analytics related to college teams from Indiana and professional teams from Pennsylvania.
