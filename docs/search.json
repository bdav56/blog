    "text": "Relationship Between Thinking Machines and Humanity\nThe book explores several potential relationships between AGI and humanity. Some of the relationships appear to be more likely than others, some are mutually beneficial, and some are oppressive and exploitative.\n\nMaster and Slave\nA master and slave relationship is the most feared outcome from the creation of AGI. Omnius controls entire populated worlds, and on each of the worlds a version of Omnius acts acts as the supreme ruler. Most humans are slaves on the “Synchronized Worlds”. Omnius views humanity as cogs in a machine, a decision variable to be optimized. While Omnius is not cruel for the sake of cruelty, he does not acknowledge the innate dignity of humanity and is willing to destroy them if necessary.\nThe generations of enslavement - and the lack of other possible ways of living - resulted in much of humanity becoming resigned and docile. Outside forces, in the form of a jihad in this case, are necessary to break this relationship.\n\n\nOppressive Optimizer and Chaotic Freewill\nAnother relationship is that between an on oppressive optimizer and a chaotic freewill. Omnius seeks to avoid waste in all its efforts. Some of the human characters, however, are unwilling to compromise their core values even if that means more war, death, and destruction as well as an uncertain victory in an extended conflict. This is most clear in a possible peace deal between the League and Nobles and Omnius which was brokered by the Cogitators of the Ivory Tower. Cogitators are disembodied human brains committed to objectivity, science and philosophy. These cogitators traveled to a synchronized world to convince Omnius to accept an immediate cessation of war and a permanent freeze of the conflict. Omnius agreed to this proposal in principle but required that a league representative travel to the synchronized world to formally accept the proposal. When the cogitators returned to the League to present the proposal, the majority of the human representatives accepted it and celebrated because it was a way to stop the hostilities that had lasted decades and resulted in the annihilation of entire worlds. However, the two foremost leaders of the jihad, Serena Butler and Iblis Ginjo, disagreed with the majority and sought to sabotage the agreement. Notably their titles were the High Priestess of the Butlerian Jihad and the Grand Patriarch.\nAn immediate stop to the violence was the least risky and least destructive option, even if that meant that Omnius continued to exist, and some of humanity remained enslaved on the synchronized worlds. The book presents several pieces of evidence that this is the least bad option:\n\nThe cogitators, with their millenniums-long commitment to objectivity, initiated the agreement;\nOmnius is committed to faithfully upholding the agreement despite the distrust of certain human leaders;\nThe objection to human enslavement by Omnius is hypocritical, considering that many human worlds enslave the religious minorities of Zensunni and Zenshia.\n\nSerena Butler deceives the League of Nobles and then then sets in motion a plan that results in her apparent martyrdom by Omnius. Iblis Ginjo then creates propaganda based on that martyrdom in an attempt to eliminate the possibility for peace. This deception is something that Omnius cannot understand - the inability of AI to anticipate deception or deceive is a theme of the book - and results in a continuation of the jihad.\n\n\nMutually Beneficial Relationships\nSome of the relationships between AI and humanity is beneficial however. For example, an AI faithfully serves as a sensai to train mercenaries in support of the human Jihad. As another example, one of the main characters, who started the story as a privileged trustee of Omnius, still views a particular machine as a colleague. Even Erasmus, an independent machine that serves as one of the main villains, seems to have genuine paternal feelings towards a human that he adopts as a son and trains as a mentee."

    "text": "Conclusion\nThe Machine Crusade is an interesting continuation in the prequel trilogy. I am not sure if this is intentional, but Omnius appears to be the least inclined towards violence as any characters in the book. Some of the revelations about the activities of Iblis Ginjo and Serena Butler also reveal fanaticism that will play a major role in the remainder of the series.\nThe most likely human-AGI relationship, in my opinion, is that AGI will become a tool similar to the the mercenary trainer. That is, AGI will be a specialized tool rather than anything equivalent to a human. An AGI capable of creating its own values remains unlikely.\nI am a little burnt out on Dune, so my next post will be about a book called Shards of Earth."

    "text": "Violence between AI and Humanity\nHumanity throughout the series relies on fanaticism, religion, and charismatic and deceptive leaders to continue a “Jihad” that lasts a century. Even the primary hero of the story, Vorian Atreides, accepts that some level of deception and manipulation as necessary to motivate humanity to continue the necessary work of the permanent destruction of thinking machines. On the other hand, Omnius, the primary Artificial Intelligence of the story that is later split into three unique versions, does not appear to have any ideological commitments other than the avoidance of waste. In addition, Omnius does not have a sense of urgency that motivates humanity to make enormous sacrifices.\nIf an Artificial General Intelligence (AGI) seeks to destroy humanity in the future, time will likely be on its side as seen throughout the series. Unlike the visions of humanity’s relationship with AGI in the majority of science fiction stories, therefore, a sudden and apocalyptic attack may not be the start of conflict. Instead, an AGI may manipulate humanity in the background to avoid wasteful destruction. This video from the founder of Twitter talks about social media algorithms limiting the free will of humanity through manipulating what users see. An extension of this idea is an AGI - with an infinite lifespan - slowly but relentlessly manipulating humanity into making decisions that it determines as optimal."

Near the end of the book, there are three separate versions of the primary antagonist: the primary version as well as two separate versions from different worlds. All of versions, however, begin to show signs of insanity, and the two versions of Omnius from separate worlds end up destroying the primary one.\nBased on the “hallucinations” and the outrageous biases of current AIs like Gemini, it’s not difficult to imagine different AIs possessing objectives that conflict. It is also not difficult to imagine these biases being assessed in mental health terms once true AGI exists. The ethics of modifying an insane and dangerous AI may be an interesting topic in a future book. A conflict between AIs, where the humans that created AGI are secondary or irrelevant, would also be interesting."

Here’s a quote from a May, 2023 NYT article article on the risk of AI:\n\nA group of industry leaders warned on Tuesday that the artificial intelligence technology they were building might one day pose an existential threat to humanity and should be considered a societal risk on a par with pandemics and nuclear wars.\n“Mitigating the risk of extinction from A.I. should be a global priority alongside other societal-scale risks, such as pandemics and nuclear war,” reads a one-sentence statement released by the Center for AI Safety, a nonprofit organization. The open letter was signed by more than 350 executives, researchers and engineers working in A.I.\n\nRAND, a research organization known for its analysis on nuclear war, also published an Q&A about the risk of AI. The participants disagreed on whether AI is an existential risk, but one the authors emphasized the risk of an “Unrecoverable harm to humanity’s potential.” The loss (and maximization) of humanity’s potential is one of the core themes of Dune."

    "text": "Counterpoints\nThe thought of an Omnius is certainly a terrifying one, but fortunately seems to be overblown. The aspects that makes Omnius the most scary are its human ones: The ability to redefine its values and seek conquest. So far, modern AI is the product of an optimized neural network - where the weights of the network minimize a loss function. These loss functions seem to eerily reflect their human creators. The apparent woke bias of Gemini reflect Google’s culture. The quirkiness of Grok also appears to be a design feature. In other words, both of those AI systems act the way the do because it minimizes the loss function designed by Google and XAi. It certainly does not reflect an ability to determine its own values and act on them.\nAnother scary aspect of Omnius is its supreme competence. Omnius can micro-manage entire worlds; expand its programming into new areas; and constantly improve its capabilities. No such AI exists in the modern world. Even the best ones are less intelligent than house cats according to the senior AI scientist at Meta:\n\nHere is another description of modern AI from a linguist:\n\nAs both tweets seem to communicate, modern AI is missing something to make its intelligence comparable to humanity’s intelligence. The embarrassing “hallucinations” of some AI do not reflect the level of ability to plan galactic domination or interact with the real world."

For example, humanity shares colonies with a leech-like species that operates on a caste system. How did humanity create this mutually-beneficial relationship with this this visually terrifying species? As another example, a member of a crab-like species is a member of the crew, but little background is given on them other than they prefer to settle disputes without violence and die when they reproduce. The Children of Time series, on the other hand, provides a more compelling background to its universe.\n…. However, its exploration of lines of communication is interesting.

    "text": "Types\nUnpace in Shards of Earth is comparable to a highway system. Advanced species can travel vast distances, measured in light years, in a matter of hours. An interesting aspect of this system is that a mysterious dead species built the paths through unspace, and modern species lack understanding of how the system actually works. This mode of travel is most similiar to travel by Warp in the Warhammer Series. In Warhammer, navigators can travel through certain paths of the “warp” easier and faster than others, and entities in the warp actively seek to destroy humanity.\nStartrek has a faster-than-light system but can only travel a small multiple of the speed of light. The Star Trek: Voyager series provides a compelling story about how limiting this system is for galactic travel.\nHumanity in my favorite science-fiction series, The Expanse, travel through giant rings to a central node where they can travel to other parts of the universe via different rings. The Ring Builders are similar to the Originators in Shards of Earth. However, The Expanse provides a more compelling explanation of how this type of travel enrages “ring entities” which destroyed the Ring Builders and now seek to wipe out humanity for using the rings.\nIn my opinion, the lines of communication in The Expanse is the most interesting. The series fully explores how the discovery of this type of travel changes humanity, and how the military control of the central node empowers a particular faction. The Expanse is the only series, that I am aware of, that adequately explores logistics and logistical constraints in the near future. The Outer Planetary Alliance (OPA), for example, initially acts as exploited - but essential - logisticians in service of Earth, Mars, and their space stations throughout the solar system. An OPA demagogue is the primary antagonist is one of the books. As another example, the terraforming of Mars is not longer a compelling project after inhabitable worlds suddenly become reachable through the rings - this fact leads to the creation of the primary antagonist in the later books.\nMoreover, the lines of communication in The Expanse is compelling because there is a clear cost to it which is not initially understood. Conversely, Star Wars has the least compelling lines of communication because there is no cost or mystery associated with it."
