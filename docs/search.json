Babylon brings the elites of Judea into Babylon and gives them a period to prove their usefulness to the empire and its capricious king. The story focuses on Daniel as he maintains his dignity under the oppressor and proves his usefulness by interpreting the King’s dreams. The King, Nebacanezar, kills servants that are not useful or displease him."

    "section": "Science Fiction Twist",
    "text": "Science Fiction Twist\nThe Carryx strengthen their empire in a similar way to Babylon. However, it possesses client species instead of client nations. The client species are all intelligent and must prove their usefulness to the empire or face extermination. In the case of humans, the main characters are researchers that must find a way to make food from one solar system nutritious to intelligent life from another. They must solve most of their own problems with minimal help from the empire, including medication for a mentally ill researcher and defense from another species with the same project.\nUnlike King Nebuchadnezzar, the Carryx are not capricious; They are amoral and ruthlessly logical. Their motto is “Whatever is, is.” They assess themselves to be “the bones and nervous systems” of the empire, but the client species also contribute: some of the coolest images in the book are of giant obelisks and faster-than-light travel, both created with the assistance of client species. One Carryx claims that “Good and evil are constructs of lesser beings built to create divisions in places where rigor and intelligence are sufficient.” Instead of considering the morality of cutting down a tree and using its wood, Carryx efficiently adjust the status and resources available to their client races based on their “Essential nature and place in society.” Interestingly, they apply the same ruthless philosophy to themselves: several other cool images relate to the increase and decrease of of status among the Carryx. One Carryx, which performed well, changes physically based on a pheremonal response to a superior. Another, which performs poorly, submits to ritual where its leg is broken.\nThis take on Daniel is interesting because it acknowledges the rarest resource in the universe is consciousness, intelligence, and creativity. Travelling across the universe to strip-mine a planet is irrational, but conquering humanity with the expectation that it can solve some of the Empire’s problems using its “capacities, perspectives, and particular utilities” is not.\nIt is also interesting because it is a thought experiment on how to maintain dignity among oppressors. One character plans a doomed attack with zero chance of success. Conversely, the Daniel of the story attempts to gain status within the Empire with the objective of meaningful revenge later, even as he acknowledges that the willing service to the Carryx is humiliating."

More specifically, the book takes place in the distant future without a sufficient explanation of how humanity reached the status quo. For example, humanity shares colonies with a leech-like species that operates on a caste system. How did humanity create this mutually-beneficial relationship with this this visually terrifying species? As another example, a member of a crab-like species is a member of the crew, but little background is given on them other than they prefer to settle disputes without violence and die when they reproduce. The Children of Time series, on the other hand, provides a more compelling background to its universe.\n…. However, its exploration of lines of communication is interesting.

    "text": "Types\nUnpace in Shards of Earth is comparable to a highway system. Advanced species can travel vast distances, measured in light years, in a matter of hours. An interesting aspect of this system is that a mysterious dead species built the paths through unspace, and modern species lack understanding of how the system actually works. This mode of travel is most similiar to travel by Warp in the Warhammer Series. In Warhammer, navigators can travel through certain paths of the “warp” easier and faster than others, and entities in the warp actively seek to destroy humanity.\nStartrek has a faster-than-light system but can only travel a small multiple of the speed of light. The Star Trek: Voyager series provides a compelling story about how limiting this system is for galactic travel.\nHumanity in my favorite science-fiction series, The Expanse, travel through giant rings to a central node where they can travel to other parts of the universe via different rings. The Ring Builders are similar to the Originators in Shards of Earth. However, The Expanse provides a more compelling explanation of how this type of travel enrages “ring entities” which destroyed the Ring Builders and now seek to wipe out humanity for using the rings.\nIn my opinion, the lines of communication in The Expanse is the most interesting. The series fully explores how the discovery of this type of travel changes humanity, and how the military control of the central node empowers a particular faction. The Expanse is the only series, that I am aware of, that adequately explores logistics and logistical constraints in the near future. The Outer Planetary Alliance (OPA), for example, initially acts as exploited - but essential - logisticians in service of Earth, Mars, and their space stations throughout the solar system. An OPA demagogue is the primary antagonist is one of the books. As another example, the terraforming of Mars is not longer a compelling project after inhabitable worlds suddenly become reachable through the rings - this fact leads to the creation of the primary antagonist in the later books.\nMoreover, the lines of communication in The Expanse is compelling because there is a clear cost to it which is not initially understood. Conversely, Star Wars has the least compelling lines of communication because there is no cost or mystery associated with it."

    "text": "Relationship Between Thinking Machines and Humanity\nThe book explores several potential relationships between AGI and humanity. Some of the relationships appear to be more likely than others, some are mutually beneficial, and some are oppressive and exploitative.\n\nMaster and Slave\nA master and slave relationship is the most feared outcome from the creation of AGI. Omnius controls entire populated worlds, and on each of the worlds a version of Omnius acts acts as the supreme ruler. Most humans are slaves on the “Synchronized Worlds”. Omnius views humanity as cogs in a machine, a decision variable to be optimized. While Omnius is not cruel for the sake of cruelty, he does not acknowledge the innate dignity of humanity and is willing to destroy them if necessary.\nThe generations of enslavement - and the lack of other possible ways of living - resulted in much of humanity becoming resigned and docile. Outside forces, in the form of a jihad in this case, are necessary to break this relationship.\n\n\nOppressive Optimizer and Chaotic Freewill\nAnother relationship is that between an on oppressive optimizer and a chaotic freewill. Omnius seeks to avoid waste in all its efforts. Some of the human characters, however, are unwilling to compromise their core values even if that means more war, death, and destruction as well as an uncertain victory in an extended conflict. This is most clear in a possible peace deal between the League and Nobles and Omnius which was brokered by the Cogitators of the Ivory Tower. Cogitators are disembodied human brains committed to objectivity, science and philosophy. These cogitators traveled to a synchronized world to convince Omnius to accept an immediate cessation of war and a permanent freeze of the conflict. Omnius agreed to this proposal in principle but required that a league representative travel to the synchronized world to formally accept the proposal. When the cogitators returned to the League to present the proposal, the majority of the human representatives accepted it and celebrated because it was a way to stop the hostilities that had lasted decades and resulted in the annihilation of entire worlds. However, the two foremost leaders of the jihad, Serena Butler and Iblis Ginjo, disagreed with the majority and sought to sabotage the agreement. Notably their titles were the High Priestess of the Butlerian Jihad and the Grand Patriarch.\nAn immediate stop to the violence was the least risky and least destructive option, even if that meant that Omnius continued to exist, and some of humanity remained enslaved on the synchronized worlds. The book presents several pieces of evidence that this is the least bad option:\n\nThe cogitators, with their millenniums-long commitment to objectivity, initiated the agreement;\nOmnius is committed to faithfully upholding the agreement despite the distrust of certain human leaders;\nThe objection to human enslavement by Omnius is hypocritical, considering that many human worlds enslave the religious minorities of Zensunni and Zenshia.\n\nSerena Butler deceives the League of Nobles and then then sets in motion a plan that results in her apparent martyrdom by Omnius. Iblis Ginjo then creates propaganda based on that martyrdom in an attempt to eliminate the possibility for peace. This deception is something that Omnius cannot understand - the inability of AI to anticipate deception or deceive is a theme of the book - and results in a continuation of the jihad.\n\n\nMutually Beneficial Relationships\nSome of the relationships between AI and humanity is beneficial however. For example, an AI faithfully serves as a sensai to train mercenaries in support of the human Jihad. As another example, one of the main characters, who started the story as a privileged trustee of Omnius, still views a particular machine as a colleague. Even Erasmus, an independent machine that serves as one of the main villains, seems to have genuine paternal feelings towards a human that he adopts as a son and trains as a mentee."

I am not sure if this is intentional, but Omnius appears to be the least inclined towards violence as any characters in the book. Some of the revelations about the activities of Iblis Ginjo and Serena Butler also reveal fanaticism that will play a major role in the remainder of the series.\nThe most likely human-AGI relationship, in my opinion, is that AGI will become a tool similar to the the mercenary trainer. That is, AGI will be a specialized tool rather than anything equivalent to a human. An AGI capable of creating its own values remains unlikely.\nI am a little burnt out on Dune, so my next post will be about a book called Shards of Earth."

The Titans completed the revolution quickly, and each received worlds to rule.\nThe success of the Titans did not last: One of the Titans, seeking to maximize time for hedonistic pursuits, granted an AI called Omnius excessive permissions to manage his assigned world.

Here’s a quote from a May, 2023 NYT article article on the risk of AI:\n\nA group of industry leaders warned on Tuesday that the artificial intelligence technology they were building might one day pose an existential threat to humanity and should be considered a societal risk on a par with pandemics and nuclear wars.\n“Mitigating the risk of extinction from A.I. should be a global priority alongside other societal-scale risks, such as pandemics and nuclear war,” reads a one-sentence statement released by the Center for AI Safety, a nonprofit organization. The open letter was signed by more than 350 executives, researchers and engineers working in A.I.\n\nRAND, a research organization known for its analysis on nuclear war, also published an Q&A about the risk of AI. The participants disagreed on whether AI is an existential risk, but one the authors emphasized the risk of an “Unrecoverable harm to humanity’s potential.” The loss (and maximization) of humanity’s potential is one of the core themes of Dune."

The aspects that makes Omnius the most scary are its human ones: The ability to redefine its values and seek conquest. So far, modern AI is the product of an optimized neural network - where the weights of the network minimize a loss function. These loss functions seem to eerily reflect their human creators. The apparent woke bias of Gemini reflect Google’s culture. The quirkiness of Grok also appears to be a design feature. In other words, both of those AI systems act the way the do because it minimizes the loss function designed by Google and XAi. It certainly does not reflect an ability to determine its own values and act on them.\nAnother scary aspect of Omnius is its supreme competence. Omnius can micro-manage entire worlds; expand its programming into new areas; and constantly improve its capabilities. No such AI exists in the modern world. Even the best ones are less intelligent than house cats according to the senior AI scientist at Meta:\n\nHere is another description of modern AI from a linguist:\n\nAs both tweets seem to communicate, modern AI is missing something to make its intelligence comparable to humanity’s intelligence. The embarrassing “hallucinations” of some AI do not reflect the level of ability to plan galactic domination or interact with the real world."

    "text": "Violence between AI and Humanity\nHumanity throughout the series relies on fanaticism, religion, and charismatic and deceptive leaders to continue a “Jihad” that lasts centuries. Even the primary hero of the story, Vorian Atreides, accepts that some level of deception and manipulation is necessary to motivate humanity to continue the necessary work of the permanent destruction of thinking machines. On the other hand, Omnius, the primary Artificial Intelligence of the story that is later split into two other unique versions, does not appear to have any ideological commitments other than the avoidance of waste. In addition, Omnius does not have a sense of urgency that motivates humanity to make enormous short-term sacrifices.\nIf an Artificial General Intelligence (AGI) seeks to destroy humanity in the future, time will likely be on its side as seen throughout the series. Unlike the visions of humanity’s relationship with AGI in the majority of science fiction stories, therefore, a sudden and apocalyptic attack may not be the start of conflict. Instead, an AGI may manipulate humanity in the background to avoid wasteful destruction. This video from the founder of Twitter talks about social media algorithms limiting the free will of humanity through manipulating what users see. An extension of this idea is an AGI - with an infinite lifespan - slowly but relentlessly manipulating humanity into making decisions that it determines as optimal."

All of versions, however, begin to show signs of insanity, and the two versions of Omnius from separate worlds end up destroying the primary one.\nBased on the “hallucinations” and the outrageous biases of current AIs like Gemini, it’s not difficult to imagine different AIs possessing objectives that conflict. It is also not difficult to imagine these biases being assessed in mental health terms once true AGI exists. The ethics of modifying an insane and dangerous AI may be an interesting topic in a future book. A conflict between AIs, where the humans that created AGI are secondary or irrelevant, would also be interesting."

    "section": "A Parable of Two Sons",
    "text": "A Parable of Two Sons\nThe Judge tells a parable in the ruins of an Indian tribe that efficiently describes his world view. A man lives in the wilderness with his wife and son. A visitor meets the father; the father attempts to cheat him; and the visitor provides a lecture on how he is a “Loss to God and man alike and would remain so until he took his brother into his heart as he would take himself.” The son supports this message, and the father repents and swears that the visitor and son are correct. However, the Father kills the man in secret and then lies to his family about it. The wife makes a tombstone to mourn the visitor.\nAs the father lay dying, he admits his crime to his son. This son destroys the tombstone and scatters the bones of the visitor. He then becomes a killer of men. As a “rider” to the story, the Judge introduces the young wife of the visitor who bears a son after the visitor’s death. This second son possesses a false and speculative history of his father.\nThe parable concludes by saying that sons are heirs to their father’s death more than their property. In addition, the Judge states that the second son is “Broken before a frozen God and will never find his way.” Unlike the first son, the second does not understand the “Small mean ways that tempered the man in life.” At the end of the book, the author introduces a decedent of the visitor, and this descendant is also a killer of men.\nThe point of the parable appears to be that the audience should acknowledge the historical law which the Judge describes throughout the book as the predatory culling of the weak and the love of games played for stakes. To borrow a phrase from the Judge used in another part of the book, the inheritance of violence in human nature endures. To answer the question proposed at the beginning of the book, the heart of man cannot change."

    "section": "The Primacy of Historical Law",
    "text": "The Primacy of Historical Law\nJudge Holden believes historical law subverts moral law because moral law cannot be proven by any ultimate test while an ultimate test exists for historical law. The ultimate test for historical law is both the ultimate trade and ultimate game: war. War supersedes views of the combatants on equity an rectitude. In addition, a “larger will” makes an irrevocable selection between two competing wills during war, and this selection is the truest form of divination. At the end of the book, the Judge adds to this argument by saying that the God of Vengeance an God of Compassion are silent and will remain silent. In other words, the larger will expresses its preferences exclusively through the outcome of conflict.\nThe Judge elaborates on his view of historical law throughout the book. He states that observation is a requirement for occurrence, and that anything that exists without his knowledge “Exists without his consent.” In a description of giant animal bone discovered in the desert, he also states “The mystery is that there is no mystery.” The Judge, therefore, seeks to expand his knowledge as a means of reducing the autonomy of others and denies the existence of any natural order that cannot be discovered."

    "section": "The Kid Becomes a Man",
    "text": "The Kid Becomes a Man\nThe Kid becomes the Man when he rejects the arguments of the Judge and shows compassion to an elderly women by offering to escort her from a dangerous place. There is no conflict here, no test of wills, and no culling of the weak. The elderly women is similar to a weak man that Judge expresses contempt for as he attempts to convert the Man to his worldview one last time—both the elderly women and the pathetic man are unable to exert their will onto others.\nAt the climax of this book, the Kid becomes the Man when he accepts a moral law and acts on it. In the outworking of the climax, however, Judge Holden appears to murder the Man in an outhouse. After the murder, he then proceeds to dance, which the book metaphorically associates with violence, and claim that he will never die. In my view, this climax and outworking propose that the acceptance of moral law is good even if the historical law ultimately overcomes it. It also illustrates how war is the truest form of divination: The Kid dies forgotten in an outhouse while the Judge endures. This is a dark assessment of the human condition that also appears in other works by Cormac McCarthy."

    "section": "Conclusion",
    "text": "Conclusion\nThe Wild West was both the meridian and evening of a environment where violence is the primary means to resolve conflict. It therefore provides unique insights into human nature. The book seems to be a inversion of the argument in Mere Christianity by C.S. Lewis. Instead of of an argument for moral law based on the human tendency to appeal to fairness, Blood Meridian argues for historical law based on the human tendency towards violence and the ability of violence to supersede any other argument. Blood Meridian also takes a firm stance on the perfectibility of human nature: Although it can be perfected in a limited way, the perfection is irrelevant in the face of historical law.\nThis is not a book that I would like to read again, but I’m glad I read it. The author does a great job of describing the rhythm of the Wild West by beautifully describing the geography with interjections of horrific violence.\nThe authors assessment of the human condition is dark…. The next book I read will probably be on the lighter side."

    "title": "Freedom for The Thought We Hate",
    "section": "",
    "text": "Introduction\nThe level of freedom of speech in the US is unique, and the commitment to free speech among Americans remains uniquely strong. I read Freedom for the Thought we Hate by Anthony Lewis to better understand freedom of speech in the US.\nThe founding fathers codified this freedom in the First Amendment of the US Constitution:\n\nCongress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion, or prohibiting the free exercise thereof; or abridging the freedom of speech, or of the press; or the right of the people peaceably to assemble, and to petition the Government for a redress of grievances.\n\nThis “parchment guarantee”, however, does not ensure freedom. In fact, shortly after the passage of the amendment, congress passed a law to make disrespectful comments to the President illegal. Fortunately, an improving understanding of the constitution, judicial courage, and the common commitment to free speech resulted in our unique freedom overtime. The law related to disrespecting government officials outraged Americans and resulted in the next congress quickly overturning the law - an electoral victory for free speech. Many other improvements were the result of bold judicial decisions that checked other branches of government and formed lasting legal precedents.\n\n\nGeneral Philosophy\nThe “Right of freely examining public characters and measures” is at the core of the the founding father’s theory of government. Freedom of speech and freedom of the press are the essential supports for this theory because they expose and check governmental abuses. In addition, freedom of speech ensures the people find the truth in “The marketplace of ideas.”\nIn the words of one supreme court justice:\n\nThe ultimate good desired is better reached by free trade in ideas - that the best test of truth is the power of the thought to get itself accepted in the competion of the market, and the truth is the only ground upon which their wishes safely can be carried out.\n\nAnother supreme court justice said that “Freedom to think as you will and to speak as you think are means indispensable to the discovery and spread of political truth.” He also stated that the temptation to censor speech is counter productive because breeds fear, repression, and hate.\n\n\nTypes of Repression\nGovernments generally have two tools to repress freedom of speech: licensing systems for publications and seditious libel laws. Licensing systems restrict freedom of the press to publication that are not approved by the state. Seditious libel laws forbid speech that disrespects the government or its officials - even if that speech is objectively true. Initially, some judges in the US thought that the First Amendment only prevented licensing requirements.\nPowerful citizens and government officials have other tools to repress freedom of speech in countries without First Amendment protections: unjust libel laws. As an example, libel lawsuits in the UK can force publications to delay publishing information until publication proves the information is true - the legal expense itself forces self-censorship and limits the timeliness, and therefore the value, of information to the public. This is similar to licensing systems for the press because it occurs prior to any speech taking place.\n\n\nFreedom of Speech for Every American\nThe current understanding of freedom of speech evolved via Supreme Court precedents as well as dissenting opinions that revealed the “brooding spirit” of constitutional thought.\n\nIncitement of Crime\nThe anti-censorial soul of the first amendment revealed itself in fits and starts. One of the first major evolutions is that restriction on speech is unconstitutional without a “clear and present danger” that it will cause “substantive evils that Congress has the right to prevent.” In other words, the “tendency” of speech to incite crime in the future was no longer constitutionally acceptable reason to punish speech.\nAn influential dissent added “imminent” and “forthwith” requirements. Together, these two evolution formed the foundation of the Brandenburg test. Constitutional convictions related to speech must be for advocacy:\n\nDirected to inciting or producing imminent lawless action, and\nlikely to produce such action.\n\nThis is an extreme restriction that protects “speech we hate”, and the US is stronger because of it.\n\n\nLibel\nThe First Amendment also restricts libel lawsuits from public officials. The official must prove that a “False, damaging statement had been made with knowledge of its falsity” or a reckless disregard for the truth or falsity of the statement. The burden of proof in libel lawsuits, therefore, is on the official. In more plain terms, government officials must prove the statement was damaging and that the speaker either intentionally lied or the the speaker was aware of the statement’s “probable falsity”. The difficulty of meeting this burden ensures that the press and regular Americans can comment on public officials in accordance with the Madisonian principles of government.\nThe background of this understanding of the First Amendment is the civil rights movement. State government officials sued newspapers for libel related to abuse of African Americans - the court cases bankrupted newspapers and intimidated journalist from printing negative stories. The First Amendment’s restrictions on libel lawsuits ensured that journalists could continue to expose civil rights abuses, and this played an essential part in the development of civil rights protections.\n\n\nHate Speech\nHate speech is also constitutional. Although this protection is uncomfortable, it ensures that we are “Aware of terrible beliefs and strengthen our resolve to combat them (162).” It also ensures that the government does not legislate thought crime for undesirable political views - Director Hoover and Senator McCarthy violated the First Amendment by punishing citizens for undesirable political beliefs, and History repudiated them both.\nIn addition, by protecting the right to possess extreme views and speak noxious ideas, the First Amendment protects the broad center and incentives good speech to counter “evil counsels.” In the words of Justice Brandeis, “Sunshine is the best disinfectant.”\nAs I write this, European governments are arresting their citizens for post on social media. In the UK in particular, the current government is arresting people for posts related to certain communities, largely Pakistani Muslims, abusing hundreds of thousands of young girls, who were and are mostly working class and white. If the British possessed basic free speech protections, they would be able to say uncomfortable truths, and these truths could have protected the innocent - the marketplace of ideas could have worked to properly define the problem and find acceptable solutions. With first amendment protections, ignorance of the scope of the problem would have been impossible, and the profound cowardice of public officials in the UK would have been punished through the ballet box.\n\n\n\nConclusion\nThe founding fathers defined revolutionary principles related to free speech. Like many other of these principles, it took time to fully implement. The judicial branch, through a series of bold decisions, explored and legally implemented those revolutionary ideas."

    "section": "Core River Traits",
    "text": "Core River Traits\nThe River is a specific world view that tends to attract people with certain cognitive and personality traits (pg. 23). These traits often result in a clash with other groups, particularly those associated with politics.\nThe River views the world as “Complicated, stochastic, and contingent (pg. 16).” As a result, The River necessarily thinks of the world in terms of probability, expected value, and risk. In the prologue, On the Edge talks about how a slight “edge” in a forecast can result in a massive expected value (pg. 14). As context, Silver discussed how his forecast predicted a 29 percent of a Trump victory in 2016 while the market predicted a 17 percent victory. With the 5:1 odds, which has the implied probability around 17, the expected value of betting $100 on a Trump victory is $74 dollars. In other words, assuming that the actual probability of a Trump victory was 29 percent, the expected return of a bet on Trump was 74 percent… Not bad.\nThinking in terms of expected value (EV) and risk tends to be closely associated with certain cognitive and personality traits (pg. 23):\n\nCognitive traits of analytically, abstracting, and decoupling;\nPersonality traits of competitive, critical, independent-minded, and risk-tolerant.\n\nTheses traits are at odds with common ways of thinking in the Village. Those on the river can decouple issues instead of thinking as a voting block with a righteous cause.\nGamblers, in particular, are necessarily more independent minded and contrarian than the Village because that is the only way to beat a bookie - betting services offer a negative EV to bettors by design. You can see the same contrarian tendency with venture capitalist looking to invest in a unique business that does not exist in the market and may be able to price its future services in a way that is similar to a monopoly - a business that can go from “Zero to One” in the words of Peter Thiel.\nIn addition, those on the river can decouple issues and analyze them. This is often foreign to politicians who punish members of their team when they go against the group consensus. Politicians also seem more focused on passing bills that build a brand and signal their virtue to voters - they focus on intentions rather than results. For example, an analytical mind on the River would not invest $42 billion in a project that produces zero results in more than 1000 days - even if their team voted for it. Instead, they would consider the EV of these bills and revise their program requirements and planned implementations to produce a positive EV. As discussed later, they would also “fold” if new information becomes available and the EV becomes clearly negative.\n\nThose on the river are also comfortable with randomization. I happen to being reading another book that also talks about about game theory optimal decisions: sometimes a mixed strategy based on a random input is the best one. A rule follower, or anyone that prefers deterministic models to stochastic ones, would not be comfortable with this."

    "section": "Characteristics of Successful Risk Takers",
    "text": "Characteristics of Successful Risk Takers\nOne of the most interesting sections is on the habits of highly successful risk takers (pg. 221). A few characteristics stuck out to me:\n\nSuccessful risk takers prepare. Two of the most interesting discussions follow from this characteristic. One is that with a sufficient amount of preparation, instinctual thinking (System 1) becomes similar to systematic thinking (System 2) (pg. 104). As an example of this, a skilled poker player that can feel the difference between a 50/50 spot and 52/48 spot. Another discussion is the valuable insights that the body produces in a high stress scenario (pg. 93), and how past experiences can be helpful in “channeling the stress to productive use (pg. 94)”.\nSuccessful risk takers focus on process and not on results. This is counterintuitive to many people in business. The example he used is a simulation of poker player, assumed to be the top 100 in skill, that results in a 40 percent chance of loosing money in a single year even though her median income in the simulation is $33,000 (pg. 110). Focusing on the process means staying the course and not adjusting the process without the necessary analysis.\nSuccessful risk takers raise or fold and possess a selective attention to detail. This is also counterintuitive. The first characteristic refers to the growing commitment to a bet that possesses an increasingly positive EV as well as the refusal to bend analysis based on sunk costs. The second, selectively focusing on what is most important, is also counterintuitive for those habituated to seek more and more data."

The first operation against the alien enemy, for example, lasts two-years from the perspective of the soldiers but 27-years from the perspective of earth.\nThis time dilation meant that connections to society necessarily became looser:\n\nFamily and friends on Earth died during campaigns;\nA new military specialty was necessary to help soldiers from earlier periods adapt to new ways of battle and new cultural norms;\nInterpersonal communication became more difficult due to “older” soldiers not being familiar with future versions of English or future customs;\nSoldiers that returned to war often felt disconnected from society - a likely reference to the experience of soldiers returning from Vietnam - and were often inclined to re-enlist despite their antipathy towards the war.\n\nIt also meant that the results of tactical engagements were more unpredictable:\n\nSuccess in battle was often a result of luck due to one side possessing weapons that were more advanced through centuries of development and adaptation to enemy tactics.\n\nAnother aspect of a universe-spanning war was that majority of governmental effort was necessary to support it. The people that actually fought were chosen based on an Elite Conscription Act and were all healthy, fit, and ingenious. The people left behind either worked desk jobs or were not a matter of significant concern for their government. A notable scene was two veterans, who recently fought in space, returning to earth to be farmers that defended themselves from raiders with antique firearms."

    "text": "Post Scarcity Societies\nIn both The Forever War and Forever Peace, society no longer faces scarcity. Instead of preceding an Utopia as some might have expect, the lack of scarcity results in a darker and more cynical society. In Forever Peace, for example, technology is capable of building anything that a society might need, and everyone receives a ration card for basic needs, and cash is only necessary for illegal activity or luxuries. At the same time, however, brutal war and cycles of violence continue without any clear explanation.\nInterestingly, in both books, people often seek jobs despite their basic needs being met, and this reveals an aspect of their personality. In The Forever War there is even a black market related to gaining and subdividing jobs."

    "text": "Mind-to-Mind Connections\nForever Peace is not a direct sequel to The Forever War, but it is a spiritual successor. The latter revealed the basic tendencies that lead societies to war, but the former discusses how peace and empathy is a more natural state for individuals. After a certain amount of time being connected brain-to-brain - and being unable to keep secrets or deceive - humans form completely accepting and empathetic collectives. These collectives are unable to harm others except as a response to an attack - or eminent attack - on the collective.\nThe last half of The Forever War is about a group of scientist seeking to “humanize” every person as a response to a discovery that could create a second Big Bang. They claim that only this level of connection and empathy can prevent the destruction of the world in the long term. Another group, called Enders resist the scientists, feel repulsed by mind-to-mind connections, and claim that pacifist humans would simply be killed by neighbors who refuse to connect to a collective.\nA mind-to-mind connection seems impossible, but a mind-to-computer interface seemed impossible a few short years ago. Maybe control over a drone via a Neuralink is in the near future."

    "section": "Conclusion",
    "text": "Conclusion\nIf humanity expands beyond the solar system, then families and societies will either need to travel to together or become isolated in the way that we saw in The Forever War. This is dark, but I cannot imagine a future where travel of that distance will not become isolating in some way.\nThe mind-to-mind connection in Forever Peace is the opposite experience: it creates a level of intimacy that most people will not accept. The first group of people to become pacifist by extended mind-to-mind connection includes rapists and cold hearted killers - most people would not like to empathize with their actions or worldviews. It would be interesting to see how a collective responds to mental illness or violence within a collective - this was somewhat explored when a member of a Soldier Boy platoon attempted suicide and was not allowed to reconnect with his platoon. It does not seem like someone could be denied connection, however, once they joined a collective.\nA mind-to-mind connection limited to the context of war, where it may be necessary for instant coordination, or people of extremely similar world views is more likely. I can imagine a group of monks having a unlimited mind-to-mind connection for example.\nThe most pressing issue discussed in the books is how humanity can maintain a family or society even when the space travel is relatively short - to Mars for example. The least pressing is how humanity should respond to the lack of scarcity because scarcity will likely always be a feature of the human condition.\n… I know I said I would read Blood Meridian in my next post, but I read two other books instead. I might finish Blood Meridian or read the Dreaming Void next."

    "title": "Two Classic Thought Experiments",
    "section": "",
    "text": "Introduction\nDo Androids Dream of Electric Sheep and The Demolished Man are classic science fiction books, and like all good science stories, their premise sets up a thought experiment. The former’s premise relates to the existence of androids that are indistinguishable from humanity with one major exception: empathy. The latter’s premise relates to the existence of telepathy and its integration into everyday life.\n\n\nHuman-like Androids\nDo Androids Dream of Electric Sheep is the inspiration for Blade Runner. It takes place in a post apocalyptic earth where human governments encourage humanity to leave earth and settle on other planets in the solar system. Humans use androids for dangerous manual labor, and corporations constantly seek to improve their androids.\nThe main character is bounty hunter that seeks to identify and kill androids that escape from their assignments. Specialized training is necessary to identify androids because current models are identical to humans with the exception of their lack of empathy and some minor physical differences. The test for empathy involves asking the android questions designed to elicit an emotional response, and then measuring their physiological response.\nThe story is interesting because of the irony of humanity assessing empathy. Most of the humans remaining on earth seek to buy electric animals - and pretend that they are real - to vainly impress their neighbors with their wealth. In addition, another bounty hunter appears to be cruel to the point that he is unsure if he is an android himself. Finally, the major religion on Earth uses technology to manipulate their own emotions. This last point makes the specialness of human empathy questionable.\nThe book seems to be a cautionary tale on creating machines that are indistinguishable from humans. Similar to Blade Runner, some of the androids are the most sympathetic characters.\n\n\nRoutine Telepathy\nThe Demolished Man is about a business man who seeks to murder his business rival. The presence of “peepers” who possess telepathic abilities complicates this intention.\nPeepers are ingrained in every aspect of life: from business transactions to medical and governmental services. The main character employees peepers to assist in business interactions and anticipate his personal desires. An organization called “The Guild” acts as a professional organization that restricts peepers from unethical behavior.\nThe book possesses the feel of comic book with constant action. Personally, however, I find it hard to imagine that normal humans would tolerate the invasion of their minds - I suspect normal humans would condemn and isolate peepers rather than make their services indispensable.\n\n\nConclusions\nBoth books were interesting, but the tone was a little too light for me. Rather than a light-hearted exploration of these two premises, I would have preferred to read thought experiments with maximum realism as the goal."
